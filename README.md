# Calc-EQD2_BED-Constrainst
EQD2 &amp; BED Calculator for Organ-at-Risk Constraints
This Windows-based tool allows users to calculate EQD2 and BED values from physical doses using the Linear-Quadratic (LQ) model. The program is designed to assist in clinical decision-making for reirradiation planning. Users can input fractionation parameters, define α/β ratios, and select specific organs at risk (OAR) to evaluate updated dose constraints.

✔ Supports BED and EQD2 computation
✔ Organ selector for constraint evaluation
✔ Adjustable α/β ratios
